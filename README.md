# Matplotlib-Challenge

This Challenge was completed for a most recent animal study done by Pymaceuticals. In this study, 250 mice identified with tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

As part of this challenge data was analyzed using Pandas and graphs were plotted to show the variations in data sets and any correlation between the factors.
